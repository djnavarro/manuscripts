	abstract = {In a study with 249 Ss, it was hypothesized that the effects associated with degree of typicality in natural semantic categories can be generated as a function of the structure of artificial categories. Three types of category were used: (a) dot patterns, in which typicality was defined as similarity to a prototype pattern in overall configuration; (b) stick figures, in which typicality was defined as closeness to a prototype figure possessing the means of attributes for the category; and (c) letter strings, in which typicality was defined as the degree of family resemblance (overlap of letters) among category members. For all 3 category types, it was found that structural typicality determined ease of item learning, speed of classification of items after learning, ratings of the typicality of items, order in which items were generated in a production task, and facilitation or inhibition of responses to items in a priming paradigm. These typicality effects were obtained both when frequency of items was equated and when rates of learning were equated by inverting the relation between frequency and typicality.
