	proposed for category-based reasoning. According to the relevance
	principle, people assume that premises are informative with respect
	to conclusions. This idea leads to the prediction that people will
	use causal scenarios and property reinforcement strategies in inductive
	reasoning. These predictions are contrasted with both existing models
	and normative logic. Judgments of argument strength were gathered
	in three different countries, and the results showed the importance
	of both causal scenarios and property reinforcement in categorybased
	inferences. The relation between the relevance framework and existing

  abstract = {(from the preface) In this book, . . . we present a new approach to
	the study of human communication. This approach . . . is grounded
	in a general view of human cognition. Human cognitive processes,
	we argue, are geared to achieving the greatest possible cognitive
	effect for the smallest possible processing effort. To achieve this,
	individuals must focus their attention on what seems to them to be
	the most relevant information available. To [verbally] communicate
	is to claim an individual's attention: hence to communicate is to
	imply that the information communicated is relevant. This fundamental
	idea . . . that communicated information comes with a guarantee of
	relevance [is referred to as the] communicative principle of relevance.
	We argue that this principle of relevance is essential to explaining
	human communication, and show . . . how it is enough on its own to
	account for the interaction of linguistic meaning and contextual
	factors in utterance interpretation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
