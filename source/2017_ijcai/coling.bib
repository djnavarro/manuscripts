  this article offers a means for indexing this knowledge so that it
  can be manipulated or controlled. We offer free association data
  for 72,000 word pairs, along with over a million entries of related
  data, such as forward and backward strength, number of competing
  associates, and printed frequency. A separate file contains the 5,019
  normed words, their statistics, and thousands of independently normed
  rhyme, stem, and fragment cues. Other files provide n x n associative
  networks for more than 4,000 words and a list of idiosyncratic responses
  for each normed word. The database will be useful for investigators
  interested in cuing, priming, recognition, network theory, linguistics,
  and implicit testing applications. They also will be useful for evaluating
  the predictive value of free association probabilities as compared
  with other measures, such as similarity ratings and co-occurrence
  norms. Of several procedures for measuring preexisting strength between
  two words, the best remains to be determined. The norms may be downloaded
  from www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},
