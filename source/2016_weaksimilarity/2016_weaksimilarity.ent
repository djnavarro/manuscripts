{0.1cm}Calculating
the
exact
number
is
slightly
complicated
because
the
extent
of
this
bias
depends
on
the
sample
size.
If
there
were
only
a
total
of
10
observations,
the
expected
value
of
the
modal
proportion
is
0.49.
When
the
sample
size
rises
to
100
the
expected
value
drops
to
0.38,
and
by
the
time
N=1000
it
falls
to
0.35.
Our
hypothesis
tests
take
this
into
account.
Our
tests
explicitly
calculate
the
sampling
distribution
for
the
modal
frequency,
and
do
not
literally
test
the
modal
frequencies
against
a
value
of
0.33.
The
R
functions
that
we
used
to
compute
these
probabilities
and
the
rest
of
the
statistical
testing
machinery
are
included
in
the
additional
materials
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {2}
macro:->\hspace
{0.1cm}Note
that
these
tests
tend
to
be
more
conservative
than
frequentist
versions
based
on
permutation
tests
for
the
mode
and
$\chi
^2$
for
the
overall
goodness
of
fit
reported
for
a
pilot
of
these
data
in
\textcite
{DeDeyne2012Weak}.
However,
across
all
experiments
reported
here,
the
same
qualitative
results
were
obtained.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {3}
macro:->\hspace
{0.1cm}We
also
considered
a
multidimensional
scaling
approach,
but
this
produced
far
less
satisfactory
results.

The
qualitative
shape
of
the
distribution
of
modal
frequencies
in
Experiments
2,
3
and
4
is
essentially
identical
to
the
pattern
from
Experiment
1
shown
in
Figure~\ref
{figure:RemoteTriadHistogram}.
To
avoid
repetition
we
have
omitted
the
corresponding
plots
for
the
later
experiments.

As
did
\textcite
{Lee1999},
we
varied
the
precision
between
values
of
0.1,
0.2
and
0.3
to
estimate
the
BIC
and
decide
on
the
number
of
internal
nodes;
the
specific
value
of
precision
did
not
impact
the
main
results.

macro:->Equation
\ref
{equation_RW_algebraic}
converges
only
for
values
of
$\alpha
<
\frac
{1}{\sigma
_{max}\mathbf
{P}}$
where
$\sigma
_{max}\mathbf
{P}$
is
the
largest
singular
value.
Given
the
fact
that
$\mathbf
{P}$
is
a
transition
matrix
for
the
largest
connected
component
of
$\mathbf
{G}$,
$\sigma
_{max}(\mathbf
{P})$
always
equals
1.
For
this
reason
only
values
of
$\alpha
$
larger
than
0
and
smaller
than
1
will
be
considered.

macro:->\hspace
{0.1cm}For
both
the
cosine
and
random
walk
similarity
measures
the
computed
similarity
values
for
each
triad
are
normalized
to
sum
to
1.
This
allows
the
model
predictions
to
be
directly
comparable
to
the
empirical
choice
probabilities,
which
also
sum
to
1.
This
is
equivalent
to
assuming
that
the
network
activation
level
corresponds
to
the
response
strength
and
using
Luce's
choice
rule
\parencite
{Luce1959}
to
construct
choice
probabilities.

macro:->This
highlights
the
strong
similarities
to
the
PageRank
measure:
$\mathbf
{X}
=
(\mathbf
{I}
-
\alpha
\mathbf
{P}^{-1})\mathbf
{1}$.
In
other
words,
the
PageRank
measure
reflects
the
centrality
of
a
node
as
the
weighted
sum
of
all
indirect
paths
it
has
\parencite
{Page1998}.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {9}
macro:->\hspace
{0.1cm}Note
that
the
results
are
quite
similar
despite
the
lack
of
an
additional
weighting
step.
This
suggests
that
the
additional
weighting
step
is
only
needed
for
unbounded
walks
in
Equation
\ref
{equation_RW_algebraic}.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {10}
macro:->\hspace
{0.1cm}The
local
overlap
measure
is
not
entirely
identical
due
to
the
inclusion
of
a
diagonal
term
in
the
first
line
of
Equation
\ref
{equation_iteration}.
The
results
were
very
comparable
with
the
largest
difference
found
for
Experiment
4,
where
$r
=
.65$
for
the
limited
walk
versus
$r
=
.68$
for
the
unbounded
walk.
