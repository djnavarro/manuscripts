	broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution

  abstract = {A rational model of human categorization behavior is presented that
	assumes that categorization reflects the derivation of optimal estimates
	of the probability of unseen features of objects. A Bayesian analysis
	is performed of what optimal estimations would be if categories formed
	a disjoint partitioning of the object space and if features were
	independently displayed within a category. This Bayesian analysis
	is placed within an incremental categorization algorithm. The resulting
	rational model accounts for effects of central tendency of categories,
	effects of specific instances, learning of linearly nonseparable
	categories, effects of category labels, extraction of basic level
	categories, base-rate effects, probability matching in categorization,
	and trial-by-trial learning functions. Although the rational model
	considers just 1 level of categorization, it is shown how predictions
	can be enhanced by considering higher and lower levels. Considering
	prediction at the lower, individual level allows integration of this
	rational analysis of categorization with the earlier rational analysis
	of memory by J. R. Anderson and R. Milson (see record 1990-03526-001).

	operation. It is proposed that the cognitive units form an interconnected
	network and that retrieval is performed by spreading activation throughout
	the network. Level of activation in the network determines rate and
	probability of recall. With these assumptions in place, the ACT theory
	is shown to predict interference results in memory, judgements of
	associative relatedness, impact of extensive practice on memory,
	the differences between recognition and recall, effects of elaborative
	processing, and effects of reconstructive recall.}

	abstractions that take the form of summary representations. Three
	central properties of these abstractions are established: ( i ) type-token

	realization. Traditional theories of representation handle interpretation
	and structure well but are not sufficiently dynamical. Conversely,
	connectionist theories are exquisitely dynamic but have problems
	with structure. Perceptual symbol systems offer an approach that
	implements all three properties naturally. Within this framework,
	a loose collection of property and relation simulators develops to
	represent abstractions. Type-token interpretation results from binding
	a property simulator to a region of a perceived or simulated category
	member. Structured representation results from binding a configuration
	of property and relation simulators to multiple regions in an integrated
	manner. Dynamic realization results from applying different subsets
	of property and relation simulators to category members on different
	occasions. From this standpoint, there are no permanent or complete
	abstractions of a category in memory. Instead, abstraction is the
	skill to construct temporary online interpretations of a category's
	members. Although an infinite number of abstractions are possible,
	attractors develop for habitual approaches to interpretation. This
	approach provides new ways of thinking about abstraction phenomena
	in categorization, inference, background knowledge and learning.},

  abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently
	perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming
	languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally
	different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual
	approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are
	assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A
	perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of
	current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience,
	association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation
	in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association
	areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual
	symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates
	at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic
	perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic
	representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience
	and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot).
	As memories of the same component become organized around a common
	frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations
	of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators
	develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for
	aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g.,
	compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators
	implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports
	categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators
	further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts,
	thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity
	results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively
	to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding
	simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations.
	Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined
	physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge
	can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding
	problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for
	cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence
	are explored.},

  abstract = {Three possible determinants of graded structure (typicality) were
	observed in common taxonomic categories and goal-derived categories:
	(1) an exemplar's similarity to ideals associated with goals its
	category serves; (2) an exemplar's similarity to the central tendency
	of its category (family resemblance); and (3) an exemplar's frequency
	of instantiation (people's subjective estimates of how often it is
	encountered as a category member). Experiment 1 found that central
	tendency did not predict graded structure in goal-derived categories,
	although it did predict graded structure in common taxonomic categories.
	Ideals and frequency of instantiation predicted graded structure
	in both category types to sizeable and equal extents. A fourth possible
	determinant--familiarity--did not predict typicality in either common
	taxonomic or goal-derived categories. Experiment 2 demonstrated that
	both central tendency and ideals causally determine graded structure,
	and work showing that frequency causally determines graded structure
	is discussed. Experiment 2 also demonstrated that the determinants
	of a particular category's graded structure can change with context.
	Whereas ideals may determine a category's graded structure in one
	context, central tendency may determine a different graded structure
	in another. It is proposed that graded structures do not reflect
	invariant structures associated with categories but instead reflect
	people's dynamic ability to construct concepts.},

	left ATL patients who demonstrated postsurgery decline on a standardized
	naming measure, it was hypothesized that naming performance would
	be significantly associated with specific attributes of the object
	names. We investigated the relation between performance on the Boston
	Naming Test (BNT) and the following attributes of the test items:
	living versus nonliving category (L/NL), word length (WL), written
	word frequency (WF), and age of acquisition (AoA). Regression analyses
	revealed that AoA and WF were significant predictors of preoperative
	group performance. AoA was the only significant predictor of performance
	after left ATL. For the 17 individuals who demonstrated a statistically
	meaningful decline on the BNT, as indicated by a Reliable Change
	Index, individual logistic regressions demonstrated that AoA was
	the strongest and most consistent predictor of postoperative success/failure

	with the literature on naming errors in elderly normals and patients
	with aphasia or semantic dementia, the results provide evidence that

    abstract = {Previous theoretical work has proposed the use of
              Markov chain Monte Carlo as a model of exploratory
              search in memory. In the current study we
              introduce such a model and evaluate it on a
              semantic network against human performance on the
              Remote Associates Test (RAT), a commonly used
              creativity metric. We find that a family of search
              models closely resembling the Metropolis-Hastings
              algorithm is capable of reproducing many of the
              response patterns evident when human participants
              are asked to report their intermediate guesses on
              a RAT problem. In particular we find that when run
              our model produces the same response clustering
              patterns, local dependencies, undirected search
              trajectories, and low associative hierarchies
              witnessed in human responses.}

	On the basis of these results, we argue that age-of-acquisition effects

	a shape is represented internally by the responses of a small number
	of tuned modules, each broadly selective for some reference shape,
	whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. This amounts to embedding
	the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space spanned by
	the outputs of the active modules. This shape space supports representations
	of distal shape similarities that are veridical as Shepard's (1968)
	second-order isomorphisms (i.e., correspondence between distal and
	proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes
	and their proximal representations). Representation in terms of similarities
	to reference shapes supports processing (e.g., discrimination) of
	shapes that are radically different from the reference ones, without
	the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts
	required by other theories. Furthermore, a general expression for
	similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference
	shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging
	from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical ones, as in multidimensional
	scaling (Shepard 1980), to discrete and nonhierarchical ones, as
	in the general contrast models (Shepard & Arabie 1979; Tversky 1977).},

  abstract = {Early-acquired words are processed faster than late-acquired words.
	This is a well-accepted effect within the word recognition literature.
	Different explanations have been proposed, either localizing the
	effect of age of acquisition (AoA) in a particular substage of word
	processing or seeing it as the result of the way in which information
	is stored and accessed in the brain in general. The cumulative-frequency
	hypothesis is an example of the latter type of explanation: it states
	that the total number of times a system has come across a particular
	stimulus will determine the speed with which the stimulus can be
	recognized. The present multi-task investigation provides a critical
	test of the different explanations. Results show that in a variety
	of word processing tasks the effects of frequency and AoA are highly
	correlated, and that the impact of AoA is consistently higher than
	would be expected on the basis of the cumulative-frequency hypothesis.
	The findings are interpreted as evidence for recent demonstrations

	perceptually-based similarity and higher-level rules in conceptual
	thought. Although such a dissociation may be justified at times,
	our goal is to illustrate ways in which conceptual processing is
	grounded in perception, both for perceptual similarity and abstract
	rules. We discuss the advantages, power and influences of perceptually-based
	representations. First, many of the properties associated with amodal
	symbol systems can be achieved with perceptually-based systems as
	well (e.g. productivity). Second, relatively raw perceptual representations
	are powerful because they can implicitly represent properties in
	an analog fashion. Third, perception naturally provides impressions
	of overall similarity, exactly the type of similarity useful for
	establishing many common categories. Fourth, perceptual similarity
	is not static but becomes tuned over time to conceptual demands.
	Fifth, the original motivation or basis for sophisticated cognition
	is often less sophisticated perceptual similarity. Sixth, perceptual
	simulation occurs even in conceptual tasks that have no explicit
	perceptual demands. Parallels between perceptual and conceptual processes
	suggest that many mechanisms typically associated with abstract thought
	are also present in perception, and that perceptual processes provide
	useful mechanisms that may be co-opted by abstract thought.},

	nature of semantic hyperpriming in schizophrenia and its relation

	not clear. To explore these issues, we administered a lexical decision
	task with semantically related, indirectly related or unrelated prime-target
	pairs to acutely ill inpatients with schizophrenia shortly after
	admission and again after 12-16 weeks, while most patients were already
	in (partial) remission (n=33). In addition, we examined 20 healthy
	control subjects twice (2 weeks apart). Relative to control subjects,
	TD patients with schizophrenia exhibited hyperpriming only in the
	acute psychotic state, but not during the follow-up examination,
	when TD and other positive symptoms had resolved. There were no associations
	between priming effects and length of illness or number of previous
	psychotic episodes. In conclusion, semantic hyperpriming in TD patients
	with schizophrenia appears to be clearly state-dependent and might
	be viewed as an episode marker of psychosis with TD.},

	because they assume that detailed, exemplar-level information is
	filtered out of category representations. Nevertheless, the instantiation
	principle can be implemented in a wide class of models, including
	both exemplar and abstraction models. To assess the instantiation
	principle empirically, a parameter-free exemplar-based model of instantiation
	was applied to typicality judgments for 16 simple categories (e.g.
	mammal, beverage) and 14 complex categories (e.g. dangerous mammal)
	in four superordinates (animal, food, small animal, dangerous animal).
	Across three studies, the model did an excellent job of predicting
	mean typicality judgments (correlations generally above 0.9) and
	a good job of predicting standard deviations (fits generally from
	0.6 to 0.9). In Study 3, predicting the skew of typicality distributions
	was successful as well (a fit of 0.87), and dropping atypical exemplars
	from the simulations degraded prediction. All of these results support
	the instantiation principle, indicating that subjects incorporate
	detailed information about category instances into their representations
	of categories.},

	of similar items are correlated. In the Minerva 2 model, global matching
	underlies frequency judgments as well as recognition memory. One
	implication of this model is that judged frequencies of similar items
	should be correlated. Another implication is that judgments of summed
	frequency for pairs of words (how many presentations were there of
	word1 and word2 combined?) should have higher variance when word1
	and word2 are similar than when they are unrelated. These predictions
	were tested and confirmed in two experiments. A review of these and
	other results suggests that theories of recognition memory should
	also be applicable to frequency-judgment tasks.},

	that predicts long-term effects for all forms of relatedness. This
	prediction is reconciled with previous failures to observe long-term
	semantic priming on the basis of 2 claims: (a) that previously used
	pairs share few semantic features and (b) that tasks typically used
	to study priming are not especially sensitive to semantic influences.
	The present experiments provide further support for these claims
	by demonstrating long-term semantic priming in the lexical-decision
	task when the stimuli and task are modified in a way that increases
	semantic involvement. However, the findings' suggest that in addition
	to the mechanism advocated by Becker et al., a second mechanism is
	necessary to provide a complete account of semantic priming effects.},

	They concluded that these effects could not originate in a graded,
	similarity-based category representation and consequently that the
	typicality effects obtained with natural categories might not be
	indicative of such a structure either. In this article, we re-examine
	this conclusion, focusing first on the performance obtained with
	well-defined categories of different sizes. Only the larger categories
	used showed variations in typicality ratings and produced typicality
	effects on categorization times. However, multiple regression analyses
	showed the effects on categorization times to be better explained
	by a measure of associative strength, called category dominance.
	The range of various predictor variables was equated in a follow-up
	experiment involving large, natural, and well-defined categories.
	Results obtained with well-defined categories showed pronounced dominance
	effects when typicality was controlled, but no reliable typicality
	effect when category dominance and instance familiarity were controlled.
	Results were opposite for natural categories. By showing that well-defined
	categories fail to produce unbiased typicality effects, our results
	bring added support to the hypothesis that the effects obtained with
	natural categories originate in a graded, similarity-based category
	structure.},

	we demonstrated how findings that challenged attractor-based networks

	consequence of our present model's dynamics. Puzzling results regarding
	backward priming were also given a straightforward explanation. In

	neighborhood was defined in terms of semantic set size and network

	network connectivity, and ambiguity were crossed. An ambiguity advantage
	was observed only within small-set low-connectivity words. In Experiment
	2, the effect of network connectivity on the processing of words
	of high and low meaning relatedness was examined. Participants responded
	more rapidly to words of high meaning relatedness, relative to words
	of low meaning relatedness, but only within high-connectivity words.
	These results are interpreted within a framework in which both semantic
	feedback processes and meaning-level competition can affect the recognition
	of semantically ambiguous words.},

	words made up of primarily rare letters. In addition, a mirror effect
	was observed: Words with rare letters had a higher hit rate and a
	lower false-alarm rate than did words with common letters. We also
	found that normative word frequency affects recognition independently
	of letter frequency. Therefore, the distinctiveness of a word's orthographic
	features is one, but not the only, factor necessary to explain the
	word-frequency effect.},

	(e.g., speaker-addressee pacts) and long-term history (e.g., the
	language's naming pattern for the domain). But these influences must
	somehow be linked. We propose that names adopted through speaker-addressee
	collaboration have influences that carry beyond the original context.
	To test this hypothesis, we adapted the standard referential communication
	task. The first director of each matching session was a confederate
	who introduced one of two possible names for each object. The director
	role then rotated to naive participants. The participants later rated
	name preference for the introduced and alternative names for each
	object. They also rated object typicality or similarity to each named
	category. The name that was initially introduced influenced later
	name use and preference, even for participants who had not heard
	the name from the original director. Typicality and similarity showed
	lesser effects from the names originally introduced. Name associations
	built in one context appear to influence retrieval and use of names
	in other contexts, but they have reduced impact on nonlinguistic
	object knowledge. These results support the notion that stable conventions
	for object names within a linguistic community may arise from local
	interactions, and they demonstrate how different populations of speakers
	may come to have a shared understanding of objects' nonlinguistic
	properties but different naming patterns.},

	principle, people assume that premises are informative with respect

	use causal scenarios and property reinforcement strategies in inductive
	reasoning. These predictions are contrasted with both existing models
	and normative logic. Judgments of argument strength were gathered

	concerned with graph-based algorithms for large-scale WSD. Under

	to identifying the most ” important” node among the set of graph
	nodes representing its senses. We introduce a graph-based WSD algorithm
	which has few parameters and does not require sense-annotated data
	for training. Using this algorithm, we investigate several measures
	of graph connectivity with the aim of identifying those best suited
	for WSD. We also examine how the chosen lexicon and its connectivity
	influences WSD performance. We report results on standard data sets
	and show that our graph-based approach performs comparably to the

	on performance, printed word frequency is typically the variable
	of choice. Despite this preference, we know little about what frequency
	norms measure. They ostensibly index how often and how recently words
	are experienced, but words appear in context, so frequency potentially
	reflects an influence of connections with other words. This paper
	presents the results of a large free association study as well as
	the results of experiments designed to evaluate the hypothesis that
	common words have stronger connections to other words. The norms
	indicate that common words tend to be more concrete but they do not
	appear to have more associates, stronger associates, or more connections
	among their associates. Two extralist cued recall experiments showed
	that, with other attributes being equal, high- and low-frequency
	words were equally effective as test cues. These results suggest
	that frequency does not achieve its effects because of stronger or
	greater numbers of connections to other words, as implied in SAM.
	Other results indicated that common words have more connections from
	other words, including their associates, and that free association
	provides a valid index of associative strength.},

	in cued recall: (a) the presence of study context words emphasizing
	lexical information, (b) lexical set size corresponding to the number
	of words that fit the letter cue, and (c) meaning set size corresponding
	to the number of meaningful associates linked to the studied targets.
	The results indicated that (a) the presence of study contexts emphasizing
	lexical information reduced accuracy and response time equally in
	all tasks, (b) larger lexical set sizes reduced accuracy and response
	time in all tasks except recognition, and (c) larger meaning set
	size reduced accuracy in cued recall but not in the other tasks.
	Lexical search appears to be a significant component process in word-stem
	cued recall, fragment completion, and identification. Searching through
	meaning-related concepts encoded during study is a significant component
	process only in cued recall.},

	added new but weak items to the set, and, when the primary associate
	was not produced on the first opportunity, it tended not to be produced
	on the second. Relative to when multiple responses are requested,
	first-response free association provides more reliable indices of
	the relative strength and set size for a word's strongest associates.
	A model of free association assuming that a strength distribution

	thought disorder in schizophrenia. However, studies to date have
	had conflicting findings. AIMS: To investigate semantic memory in
	patients with schizophrenia with and without thought disorder. METHOD:
	Data were pooled from 36 studies comparing patients with schizophrenia
	and normal controls in semantic priming tasks. Data from 18 studies
	comparing patients with thought disorder with normal controls, and
	13 studies comparing patients with and without thought disorder were
	also pooled. RESULTS: There was no support for altered semantic priming
	in schizophrenia as a whole. Increased semantic priming in patients
	with thought disorder was supported, but this was significant only
	in comparison with normal controls and not in comparison with patients
	without thought disorder. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and general
	slowing of reaction time moderated the effect size for priming in
	patients with thought disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis provides
	qualified support for increased semantic priming as a psychological
	abnormality underlying thought disorder. However, the possibility
	that the effect is an artefact of general slowing of reaction time
	in schizophrenia has not been excluded.},

	fan effects can be adequately explained by assuming differences in
	the weights given to concepts in long-term memory. When a broader

	Instead, it is better to assume that the organization of information

	more similar to the nonvariable category (quarter). This dissociation
	between categorization and similarity strongly implies that categorization
	was not based on similarity. In our first experiment, we used sparse
	descriptions like Rips's, as well as rich descriptions that contained
	features characteristic of the nonvariable category. We found that
	categorization tracked similarity with both kinds of descriptions.
	In a second experiment, we modified our procedure to be more like
	that of Rips's by requiring subjects to think aloud while making
	their decisions. Now, like Rips, we found a dissociation between
	similarity and categorization with sparse items; with rich descriptions,
	categorization again tracked similarity. These findings are consistent
	with the hypothesis that categorization can be done in two ways,
	by similarity and by rule. An exclusive reliance on rule-based categorization
	seems to occur only when the description of the to-be-categorized
	object does not contain any features characteristic of any relevant
	category.},

	follow in the property verification task (e.g., Is face a property

	predict the performance of neutral subjects, because these variables
	determine the ease of processing properties in perceptual simulations
	(i.e., perceptual effort). Second, uninstructed neutral subjects
	should spontaneously construct simulations to verify properties and
	therefore perform similarly to imagery subjects asked explicitly
	to use images (i.e., instructional equivalence). As predicted, neutral
	subjects exhibited both perceptual effort and instructional equivalence,
	consistent with the assumption that they construct perceptual simulations
	spontaneously to verify properties. Notably, however, this pattern
	occurred only when highly associated false properties prevented the
	use of a word association strategy. In other conditions that used
	unassociated false properties, the associative strength between concept
	and property words became a diagnostic cue for true versus false
	responses, so that associative strength became a better predictor
	of verification than simulation. This pattern indicates that conceptual
	tasks engender mixtures of simulation and word association, and that
	researchers must deter word association strategies when the goal

  volume = {43},
  pages = {129--169},
  abstract = {Theories of knowledge such as feature lists, semantic networks, and
	localist neural nets typically use a single global symbol to represent
	a property that occurs in multiple concepts. Thus, a global symbol
	represents mane across HORSE, PONY, and LION. Alternatively, perceptual
	theories of knowledge, as well as distributed representational systems,
	assume that properties take different local forms in different concepts.
	Thus, different local forms of mane exist for HORSE, PONY, and LION,
	each capturing the specific form that mane takes in its respective
	concept. Three experiments used the property verification task to
	assess whether properties are represented globally or locally (e.g.,
	Does a PONY have mane?). If a single global form represents a property,
	then verifying it in any concept should increase its accessibility
	and speed its verification later in any other concept. Verifying
	mane for PONY should benefit as much from having verified mane for
	LION earlier as from verifying mane for HORSE. If properties are
	represented locally, however, verifying a property should only benefit
	from verifying a similar form earlier. Verifying mane for PONY should
	only benefit from verifying mane for HORSE, not from verifying mane
	for LION. Findings from three experiments strongly supported local
	property representation and ruled out the interpretation that object
	similarity was responsible (e.g., the greater overall similarity
	between HORSE and PONY than between LION and PONY). The findings
	further suggest that property representation and verification are
	complicated phenomena, grounded in sensory-motor simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the use of similarities based on geometric distance
	in models of categorization. Two problematic implications of such
	similarities are outlined. First, in a comparison between two stimuli,
	geometric distance implies that matching features are not taken into
	account. Second, missing features are assumed not to exist. Only
	nonmatching features enter into calculations of similarity. A new
	model is constructed that is based on the ALCOVE model (Kruschke,
	1992), but it uses a feature-matching similarity measure (see, e.g.,
	Tversky, 1977) rather than a geometric one. It is an on-line model
	in the sense that both dimensions and exemplars are constructed during
	the categorization process. The model accounts better than ALCOVE
	does for data with missing features (Experiments 1 and 2) and at
	least as well as ALCOVE for a data set without missing features (Nosofsky,
	Kruschke, & McKinley, 1992). This suggests that, at least for some
	stimulus materials, similarity in categorization is more akin to
	a feature-matching procedure than to geometric distance calculation.},

	hypothesis of the meanings of object and action words. The hypothesis,

	First, it is assumed that the meanings of words are grounded in conceptual
	featural representations, some of which are organized according to
	modality. Second, it is assumed that conceptual featural representations
	are bound into lexico-semantic representations that provide an interface
	between conceptual knowledge and other linguistic information (syntax

	In experiment 1, we found that BSL signers used these imagistic properties

	more like BSL signers when asked to develop mental images for the

  abstract = {On the basis of neuropsychological and functional imaging evidence,
	meaning and grammatical class (particularly the verb-noun distinction)
	have been proposed as organizational principles of linguistic knowledge
	in the brain. However, previous studies investigating verb and noun
	processing have been confounded by the presence of systematic correlations
	between word meaning and grammatical class. In this positron emission
	tomography study, we investigated implicit word processing using
	stimuli that allowed the effects of semantic and grammatical properties
	to be examined independently, without grammatical-semantic confounds.
	We found that left hemisphere cortical activation during single-word
	processing was modulated by word meaning, but not by grammatical
	class. Motor word processing produced significant activation in left
	precentral gyrus, whereas sensory word processing produced significant
	activation in left inferior temporal and inferior frontal regions.
	In contrast to previous studies, there were no effects of grammatical
	class in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Instead, we found semantic-based
	differences within left IFG: anterior, but not posterior, left IFG
	regions responded preferentially to sensory words. These findings
	demonstrate that the neural substrates of implicit word processing
	are determined by semantic rather than grammatical properties and

	were encouraged to be as creative as possible (Experiment 4), suggesting
	that it is difficult to avoid the influence of highly accessible
	category exemplars. Other measures of category structure, including
	the rated typicality, familiarity, and frequency of exemplars, did
	not predict imagination frequency as well. The results are discussed
	in terms of expanding concept boundaries and the inadvertent application
	of knowledge that is readily accessible.},

  abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological
	oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks,
	spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing
	systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either
	completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological
	and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here
	we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this
	middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing
	amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered,
	like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths,
	like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy
	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models
	of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation
	speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular,
	infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than
	in regular lattices.},

	lexical decisions to words with large semantic neighborhoods were
	faster than those to words with sparse semantic neighborhoods. Conversely,
	this effect of semantic neighborhood was reversed for pseudohomophones
	(e.g., nale). That is, pseudohomophones based on words with large
	semantic neighborhoods took longer to reject than did those based
	on words with sparse semantic neighborhoods. In the second experiment,
	we found the magnitude of the semantic neighborhood effect for words
	to be a function of nonword foil type. Taken together, these results
	indicate that semantic neighborhood size affects processing of both
	words and pseudohomophones, and that the effect of semantic neighborhood
	size for words is more pronounced when pseudohomophone foils are
	employed. These effects are discussed in terms of a model in which
	the orthographic, phonological, and semantic systems are fully interactive.},
