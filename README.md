# Selected manuscripts

This is not a complete listing of all my papers. Instead it is a
collection of papers that I thought were worth the effort of recovering
and rebuilding from source. In each case the citation below links to the
DOI for the version of record, but I strongly prefer the versions hosted
here as they use my correct name.
